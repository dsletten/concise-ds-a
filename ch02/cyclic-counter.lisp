;;;    It seems cleaner to have the constructor (MAKE-PERSISTENT-COUNTER) pass in the
;;;    validated args rather than have an :AFTER method enforce the rules and possibly
;;;    modify existing slots. However, there is no way to restrict creation of counters
;;;    to the constructor (e.g., make MAKE-INSTANCE private...), so this is the only
;;;    way to ensure that every instance is in a legal state.
;;;
;;;    This is peculiar to CLOS since the "constructor" is sort of split between MAKE-PERSISTENT-COUNTER
;;;    and INITIALIZE-INSTANCE.
